## Overview

The Fleeticc Open API provides programmatic access to vehicle tracking data, allowing you to integrate GPS tracking capabilities into your applications. All endpoints require authentication using access tokens obtained through the Authorization endpoint.

<Warning>
  API access is restricted to paid users only (Basic and Premium plans). Free plan users cannot access any Open API endpoints.

## Authentication Flow

1. Use your Fleeticc account email and password (no separate API password needed)
2. Generate a signature using MD5 hash algorithm: `md5(md5(password) + time)`
3. Request an access token from the Authorization endpoint with password and signature
4. Use the access token for all subsequent API requests
5. Access tokens expire after 1 hour (3600 seconds)

## Rate Limiting

Rate limits are enforced per user to ensure fair usage:

- **Authorization**: 5 requests/minute per account
- **List Vehicles**: 10 requests/minute per user
- **Playback**: 5 requests/minute per user
- **Track**: 6 requests/minute per user (600 global)

## Error Handling

All endpoints return JSON responses with a consistent error format:

```json
{
  "code": 10005,
  "message": "Missing required parameter"
}
```

## Subscription Requirements

  All Open API endpoints require an active Basic or Premium subscription. Free plan users will receive error code 10007 (Permission denied).
